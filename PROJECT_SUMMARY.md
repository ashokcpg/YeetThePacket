# Packet-to-Prompt: Project Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully built a comprehensive prototype that transforms raw network packet captures (PCAP files) into human-readable security narratives using Large Language Models. The system converts complex technical network data into actionable intelligence that non-technical users can understand.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```

## 📦 Deliverables Completed

### ✅ Core Components
- **Ingestion Engine** (`backend/ingest.py`) - Processes PCAP files using tshark/pyshark
- **Detection Engine** (`backend/detect.py`) - Implements heuristic rules for security events

- **FastAPI Backend** (`backend/app.py`) - RESTful API with async processing
- **Streamlit Frontend** (`frontend/streamlit_app.py`) - Interactive web UI

### ✅ Event Detection Capabilities
- **Port Scans** - High unique destination port counts
- **Brute Force Attacks** - Repeated failed authentication attempts
- **Beaconing/C2** - Regular communication patterns
- **Data Exfiltration** - Large outbound data transfers
- **Suspicious Connections** - High failure rates and anomalous patterns

### ✅ User Experience Features
- **Timeline View** - Interactive event timeline with filtering
- **Network Graph** - Force-directed visualization of host communications
- **Event Cards** - Clean, severity-coded event summaries
- **Detailed Analysis** - AI-generated narratives with evidence references
- **Export Functionality** - PDF incident reports for stakeholders
- **Real-time Processing** - Background task processing with status updates

### ✅ Technical Infrastructure
- **Docker Deployment** - Single-command setup with docker-compose
- **Multi-LLM Support** - Pluggable architecture for different AI providers
- **Structured Data** - JSONL format for events with comprehensive metadata
- **RESTful API** - Well-documented endpoints for integration
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages

## 📊 Event Schema Implementation

Each detected event follows the specified JSON schema:
```json
{
  "id": "evt-0001",
  "start_ts": 1620000000.123,
  "end_ts": 1620000023.456,
  "src_ip": "10.0.0.5",
  "dst_ip": "10.0.0.10",
  "src_port": 12345,
  "dst_port": 22,
  "protocol": "TCP",
  "type": "port_scan|brute_force|beacon|suspicious_connection|data_exfil",
  "evidence": [...],
  "features": {...},
  "narrative": {...},
  "raw_meta": {...}
}
```

## 🤖 AI Narrative Generation

The LLM integration generates structured narratives with:
- **One-line Summary** - Concise event description
- **Technical Narrative** - Detailed analysis with evidence references
- **Executive Summary** - Non-technical explanation for management
- **Severity Assessment** - Critical/High/Medium/Low with reasoning
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** - Tactical classification
- **Remediation Steps** - Specific actionable recommendations
- **Confidence Score** - AI confidence in the analysis

## 🎨 User Interface Highlights

### Dashboard
- Event statistics and metrics
- Severity distribution charts
- Top source/destination IPs
- Time range analysis

### Event Explorer
- Filterable event list with pagination
- Severity-coded visual indicators
